            <b><i> Salty's </i></b> serves curry with different kinds of proteins. Those are my favorite dishes that they serve.
            I never knew about Salty's even existed until my brother brought me there once. Now I like to introduce the restaurant to my friends. <br /> 
            Salty's became one of my favorite restaurants due to its great food, as well as the ocean view you get while dining there.
